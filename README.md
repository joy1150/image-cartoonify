For this project we use Python libraries like OpenCV, NumPy.The basic concept of this project is to convert RGB into its accurate, cartoon image with multiple filtrations or blurred image with proper edge detection.To run this project, we need the 64bit system and we need to install Pycharm of recent version.The process to create a cartoon effect image can be initially branched into 2 divisions â€“ 1) To detect, blur and bold the edges of the actual RGB color image. 2) To smooth, quantize and the conversion of the RGB image to grayscale. The results involved in combining the image and help achieve the desired result which are:
1. Identifying the Edges
2. Colors to the RGB Image
In future we will add the application of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called Cartoon GAN will be used for the styling real-world images.With the help of GAN, it is possible to convert video as well to its cartoonized version .
